Is Valid Subsequence

Given two non-empty arrays, write a function isValidSubsequence(array, sequence) that checks if the second array (sequence) is a subsequence of the first array (array). A subsequence of an array is a set of numbers that appear in the same order in the original array, but not necessarily consecutively. For example, the array [1, 2, 3, 4] can have a subsequence [1, 3, 4], but not [1, 4, 3] as the order must be preserved.
